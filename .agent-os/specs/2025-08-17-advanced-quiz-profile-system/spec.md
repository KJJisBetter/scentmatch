## Overview

Transform the current single-personality quiz into an advanced multi-dimensional profile builder that creates detailed user preference profiles through multi-selection questions, enabling AI systems to generate highly accurate fragrance recommendations with maximum purchase conversion probability.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Profile Creation

As a fragrance explorer, I want to select multiple personality traits that describe me (like "casual AND sophisticated AND confident") so that the AI understands my complex preferences instead of forcing me into a single category box.

The current quiz makes me choose ONE personality type, but I'm sophisticated at work, casual on weekends, and always confident. I want the platform to understand my full personality so recommendations match my actual lifestyle and preferences across different situations.

### AI-Driven Purchase Optimization

As a potential customer, I want the quiz to generate a profile that leads to fragrance recommendations I'm highly likely to purchase, so that I spend money on samples I'll actually love rather than wasting money on mismatched suggestions.

The AI should use my detailed profile to recommend fragrances with extremely high purchase probability, considering my style preferences, budget approach, and usage occasions to maximize the chance I'll buy samples and convert to full bottles.

### Personalized Experience Throughout Platform

As a user, I want AI insights, descriptions, and recommendations throughout the platform to adjust to my specific profile so that everything feels personally tailored to my preferences rather than generic.

When I view fragrance pages, browse collections, or get recommendations, the AI should use my detailed profile to customize descriptions, explain why fragrances match my specific traits, and prioritize content relevant to my multi-dimensional preferences.
