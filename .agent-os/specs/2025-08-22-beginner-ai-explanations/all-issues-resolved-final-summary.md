```
"✅ Fresh & clean like you wanted / 👍 Works for school, work, dates / 💡 Similar to Sauvage but more unique"
```

**AFTER (Educational):**
```
"Noir Extreme's oriental scent family aligns with your sophisticated taste. Cardamom top notes provide warm spice opening. 8-hour longevity suits evening occasions. Amber base notes create cozy character."
```

**IMPROVEMENT**: Teaches scent families, top notes, longevity, base notes - educational not patronizing

- Clear visual hierarchy with proper spacing
- Educational badges and color-coded content boxes
```

### **✅ Issue 6: "Giving female fragrances for men" - Gender Filtering Broken**
