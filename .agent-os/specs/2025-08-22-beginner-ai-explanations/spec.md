# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Beginner AI Explanations Deployment
> Created: 2025-08-22

## Overview

Deploy the already-built beginner explanation engine in quiz results to replace verbose AI explanations with concise, visual formats optimized for fragrance beginners. This critical activation will improve beginner retention by eliminating overwhelming technical language confirmed to confuse 18-year-old users during walkthroughs.

## User Stories

### Beginner Gets Clear, Actionable Explanations

As a fragrance beginner taking the quiz, I want to receive short, visual explanations with emojis and practical advice, so that I understand why fragrances match me without feeling overwhelmed by technical jargon.

**Detailed Workflow:** User completes quiz → receives fragrance recommendations → sees concise explanations (30-40 words) with checkmarks, thumbs up, and practical guidance like "Try $14 sample before $150 bottle" instead of 150+ word technical descriptions.

### Experienced Users Still Get Detailed Information  

As an experienced fragrance user, I want to receive appropriately detailed explanations that match my knowledge level, so that I get the technical depth I need for purchasing decisions.

**Detailed Workflow:** System detects user experience level → provides adaptive explanations → experienced users see detailed breakdowns while beginners see simplified formats.

## Spec Scope

1. **Quiz Results Integration** - Activate beginner explanation engine in fragrance-recommendation-display.tsx component
2. **Format Enforcement** - Ensure 30-40 word limit validation is working in production quiz flow  
3. **Visual Format Deployment** - Replace verbose text with emoji-enhanced, scannable explanations
4. **Experience Detection** - Verify adaptive explanation system properly detects beginner vs experienced users
5. **Production Validation** - Confirm new explanation format appears in live quiz results

## Out of Scope

- Building new explanation engine (already completed)
- Modifying adaptive prompt system (already functional)
- Creating new UI components (using existing display component)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Quiz results show concise, visual explanations for beginner users (browser-testable)
2. Word count enforcement working (30-40 words max for beginner explanations)
3. Emoji and visual formatting appearing in production quiz flow
