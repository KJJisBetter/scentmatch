# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Critical Platform Debugging & Affiliate Launch Preparation
> Created: 2025-08-16
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix critical blocking issues discovered in user walkthrough testing that prevent affiliate partner launch. The platform has excellent underlying architecture but three critical technical failures are breaking core user flows and creating unprofessional user experience.

## User Stories

### Critical Bug Resolution
As a potential customer visiting from affiliate partner links, I want all core platform functionality to work reliably, so that I can complete discovery and purchase journeys without encountering application errors.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User arrives from affiliate partner link to homepage (currently works well)
2. User navigates to browse fragrances page (currently shows "useState only works in Client Components" error)
3. User attempts to create account or sign in (currently shows "Cannot read properties of undefined" error)
4. User takes quiz and attempts to search their collection (currently shows "Server Action not found" error)
5. User should be able to complete entire journey without any application errors or technical failures

### Professional Error Recovery
As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation, so that technical issues never expose raw error messages to users and affiliate partners maintain confidence in the platform quality.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. When technical errors occur, users see professional fallback messaging
2. Alternative paths are provided to achieve user goals
3. Error tracking captures issues for engineering resolution
4. Users can complete their journey through alternative flows
5. Affiliate partners see consistent professional quality

### Production Readiness Validation
As a product owner, I want comprehensive end-to-end testing validation, so that the platform meets affiliate-ready quality standards before partner launch.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. All critical user flows tested in actual browser environments
2. Cross-device and cross-browser compatibility verified
3. Performance metrics validated under load
4. Error states tested and recovery flows confirmed
5. Professional appearance maintained across all scenarios

## Spec Scope

1. **Browse Page Server/Client Component Fix** - Resolve useState error in FilterSidebar component and ensure browse functionality works completely
2. **Authentication System Complete Repair** - Fix client-side exceptions in all auth pages and restore login/signup/password reset functionality
3. **Quiz Search Integration Fix** - Resolve Server Action not found error and restore fragrance search in quiz
4. **Professional Error Boundaries Implementation** - Add comprehensive error handling that transforms technical errors into user-friendly messages
5. **Production Quality Validation System** - Implement end-to-end testing protocol that validates actual browser functionality before deployment

## Out of Scope

- New feature development or UI redesigns
- Performance optimization beyond fixing critical functionality
- SEO or marketing improvements
- Analytics or tracking implementation
- Database schema changes or migrations

## Expected Deliverable

1. **All critical user flows working in browser** - Browse, authentication, and quiz search functionality restored and tested
2. **Professional error handling implemented** - No raw technical errors visible to users, graceful degradation in place
3. **Affiliate-ready quality standard achieved** - Platform passes manual walkthrough testing for professional appearance and functionality
