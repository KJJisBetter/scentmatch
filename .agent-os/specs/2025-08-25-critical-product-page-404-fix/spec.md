> Spec: Critical Quiz Recommendation 404 Fix (SCE-71)
> Created: 2025-08-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix critical 404 errors occurring when quiz recommendations link to non-existent fragrance pages. The issue stems from ID normalization inconsistencies between the recommendation engine and fragrance database, causing "Aventus by Creed" and other fragrances to return 404s despite being recommended by the quiz.

This is a critical conversion killer affecting the beginner user flow, where users complete the quiz only to encounter broken product pages for their top recommendations.

## User Stories

**As a beginner user taking the fragrance quiz:**
- I want all recommended fragrances to have working product pages
- I want to see consistent fragrance information between quiz results and product pages
- I want to continue my discovery journey without encountering broken links

**As a product owner:**
- I want to prevent quiz recommendations from linking to non-existent pages
- I want data consistency between recommendation engine and product database
- I want automated prevention of future ID normalization issues

**As a developer:**
- I want clear ID normalization standards across all systems
- I want validation that prevents 404s from reaching production
- I want monitoring to detect data consistency issues early

## Spec Scope

**Immediate 404 Prevention:**
- Add validation layer in quiz recommendation flow
- Implement fallback handling for invalid fragrance IDs
- Create graceful degradation for missing product pages

**Data Consistency Fixes:**
- Audit and repair fragrance ID mismatches in database
- Normalize existing IDs using consistent slug generation
- Update recommendation engine to use validated IDs only

**Prevention System:**
- Implement pre-recommendation validation checks
- Add database constraints to prevent orphaned references
- Create monitoring alerts for ID consistency violations

**Browser Testing Coverage:**
- End-to-end quiz flow validation
- Fragrance page accessibility verification
- Recommendation link integrity testing

## Out of Scope

- Complete fragrance database redesign
- Migration to new ID system (beyond normalization)
- Recommendation algorithm improvements
- UI/UX changes to quiz interface
- Performance optimizations unrelated to 404 fixes

## Expected Deliverable

A production-ready fix that:
1. **Eliminates 404 errors** from quiz recommendations immediately
2. **Maintains conversion flow integrity** through graceful error handling
3. **Provides data consistency** between recommendation engine and product pages
4. **Includes comprehensive browser testing** to verify user experience
5. **Implements monitoring** to prevent future recurrence

Success criteria:
- Zero 404s from quiz recommendation links
- All recommended fragrances have accessible product pages
- Consistent fragrance data across all systems
- Automated prevention of future ID mismatches
