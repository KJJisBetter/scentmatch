# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-25-critical-product-page-404-fix/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-25
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Immediate 404 Prevention (Critical Priority)

**Task 1.1: Create Recommendation Validation Service**
- [ ] Build `lib/services/recommendation-validator.ts`
- [ ] Implement `validateBatch()` method for quiz recommendations
- [ ] Add direct lookup by normalized ID
- [ ] Add fuzzy matching for near-misses
- [ ] Include fallback recommendation generation
- [ ] **Browser Test**: Verify quiz recommendations no longer produce 404s

**Task 1.2: Add Graceful Error Handling to Fragrance Pages**
- [ ] Update `app/fragrance/[id]/page.tsx` with error boundaries
- [ ] Implement fallback display for missing fragrances
- [ ] Add "similar fragrances" section for 404 cases
- [ ] Maintain conversion flow with alternative recommendations
- [ ] **Browser Test**: Verify graceful degradation instead of 404 errors

**Task 1.3: Enhance Quiz Results Display**
- [ ] Update quiz results component to use validation service
- [ ] Add fallback handling in recommendation display
- [ ] Implement loading states during validation
- [ ] Add user-friendly messaging for substituted recommendations
- [ ] **Browser Test**: Complete end-to-end quiz flow verification

### Phase 2: Data Consistency Repair (High Priority)

**Task 2.1: Database Schema Updates**
- [ ] Create migration to add `normalized_id` column to fragrances table
- [ ] Implement ID normalization function in SQL
- [ ] Populate normalized IDs for all existing fragrances
- [ ] Add unique constraints and validation rules
- [ ] **Database Test**: Verify all fragrance IDs are properly normalized

**Task 2.2: Data Consistency Audit**
- [ ] Run database audit to identify orphaned recommendations
- [ ] Generate mapping between recommendation engine IDs and database IDs
- [ ] Create repair script for existing inconsistencies
- [ ] Execute data repair migration
- [ ] **Validation Test**: Confirm zero orphaned recommendations remain

**Task 2.3: Update Recommendation Engine**
- [ ] Modify UnifiedRecommendationEngine to use validated IDs
- [ ] Integrate recommendation validator into AI pipeline
- [ ] Update personality analyzer to work with normalized IDs
- [ ] Test recommendation generation with validation layer
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Verify AI recommendations use valid fragrance IDs

### Phase 3: Prevention System (Medium Priority)

**Task 3.1: Pre-Recommendation Validation Pipeline**
- [ ] Create `ValidatedRecommendationEngine` wrapper class
- [ ] Implement validation checks before recommendation display
- [ ] Add logging for invalid recommendation attempts
- [ ] Create monitoring alerts for ID consistency violations
- [ ] **Monitoring Test**: Verify alerts trigger for invalid recommendations

**Task 3.2: Enhanced Fragrance Lookup API**
- [ ] Update `/api/fragrance/[id]` with fallback support
- [ ] Add recommendation tracking to database
- [ ] Implement consistency monitoring endpoint
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for data quality metrics
- [ ] **API Test**: Verify all fragrance lookup scenarios work correctly

**Task 3.3: Automated Testing Infrastructure**
- [ ] Create browser tests for quiz → product page flow
- [ ] Add API tests for recommendation validation
- [ ] Set up data consistency monitoring tests
- [ ] Implement automated ID validation in CI/CD
- [ ] **CI/CD Test**: Verify automated prevention of inconsistent data

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Maintenance (Low Priority)

**Task 4.1: Performance Monitoring**
- [ ] Add performance metrics for validation layer
- [ ] Monitor impact on quiz completion times
- [ ] Track fallback usage rates
- [ ] Optimize validation query performance
- [ ] **Performance Test**: Ensure validation adds <100ms to quiz flow

**Task 4.2: Data Quality Dashboard**
- [ ] Build admin interface for consistency monitoring
- [ ] Add real-time alerts for data quality issues
- [ ] Create reports for recommendation success rates
- [ ] Implement automated data repair suggestions
- [ ] **Admin Test**: Verify dashboard provides actionable insights

**Task 4.3: Documentation and Training**
- [ ] Document ID normalization standards
- [ ] Create runbook for handling future inconsistencies
- [ ] Add monitoring playbook for on-call engineers
- [ ] Update development guidelines for fragrance ID handling
- [ ] **Documentation Test**: Verify all procedures are clearly documented

## Success Criteria

**Immediate Success (Phase 1):**
- ✅ Zero 404 errors from quiz recommendation clicks
