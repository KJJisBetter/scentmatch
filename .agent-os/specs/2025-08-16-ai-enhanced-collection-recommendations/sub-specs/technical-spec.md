# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-16-ai-enhanced-collection-recommendations/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Collection Analysis Engine

- **Collection Data Pipeline**: Analyze user's collected fragrances to extract preference patterns including scent families, note preferences, brand affinity, price sensitivity, and seasonal patterns
- **Preference Model Building**: Create comprehensive taste profiles using OpenAI GPT-4 to analyze fragrance descriptions, notes, and user interaction data
- **Dynamic Profile Updates**: Real-time preference model updates when users add/remove items from collections or provide feedback

### Enhanced Recommendation System

- **Collection-Priority Algorithm**: Weight recommendations heavily based on collection analysis (70%) vs general popularity (30%)
- **Reasoning Engine**: Generate detailed explanations for each recommendation using GPT-4 analysis of user's collection patterns
