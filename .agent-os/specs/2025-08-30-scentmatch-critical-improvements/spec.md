# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: ScentMatch Critical Production Improvements
> Created: 2025-08-30
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Overview

ScentMatch requires immediate critical improvements to address production blockers, performance bottlenecks, and UX gaps identified through comprehensive platform analysis. This specification prioritizes stability, performance, and user experience improvements that directly impact conversion and platform reliability.

## User Stories

**As a ScentMatch user, I want:**

- Quiz account creation to work reliably so I can save my preferences
- AI recommendations to load quickly (<2s) so I don't abandon my search
- Email confirmation flow to work so I can complete registration
- Mobile-optimized interface so I can browse comfortably on my phone
- TypeScript errors resolved so the platform operates reliably

**As a ScentMatch developer, I want:**

- Consistent architectural patterns so development is predictable
- Clean codebase with minimal unused components so maintenance is efficient
- Clear separation between API routes and Server Actions so performance is optimal

## Spec Scope

### Priority 1: Critical Production Blockers (Week 1)

- **SCE-96**: Fix email confirmation flow
- **SCE-97**: Resolve 89+ TypeScript compilation errors
- **SCE-98**: Fix quiz â†’ account conversion failure
- **SCE-106**: Standardize API routes vs Server Actions architecture

### Priority 2: Performance & UX (Week 2)

- **SCE-107**: Optimize AI processing performance (<2s response time)
- **SCE-93**: Implement mobile-first UX patterns
- Progressive loading states and skeleton screens

### Priority 3: Technical Debt (Week 3)

- **SCE-112**: Codebase refactoring and cleanup
- Remove unused components (~30% reduction)
- Standardize variable naming conventions
- File structure optimization

## Out of Scope

- New feature development (collections, wishlist expansion)
- Third-party integrations beyond existing scope
- Major architectural rewrites
- Database schema changes
- Design system overhaul

## Expected Deliverable

A stable, performant ScentMatch platform with:

- 100% working core user flows (quiz, registration, recommendations)
- <2 second AI recommendation response times
- Mobile-optimized interface with bottom navigation
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- Consistent architectural patterns throughout codebase
- 30% reduction in unused code/components
