> Spec: Search & Filtering System with Browse Page
> Created: 2025-08-15
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive fragrance search and filtering system with a dedicated browse page that allows users to discover fragrances through AI-powered search, advanced filtering options, and personalized recommendations. This system will leverage the existing vector database to provide intelligent matching while maintaining mobile-first design principles and progressive disclosure for different user expertise levels.

## User Stories

### Primary Discovery Story

As a fragrance beginner, I want to browse and filter fragrances by simple categories like "fresh," "warm," or "sweet," so that I can discover scents that match my preferences without being overwhelmed by technical terms.

The user lands on a browse page with intuitive filter categories, sample-first product cards, and progressive discovery options. They can search by mood, occasion, or simple scent families while the AI suggests personalized matches based on their previous interactions and stated preferences.

### Advanced Search Story

As a fragrance enthusiast, I want to search by specific notes, brands, or fragrance families with detailed filtering options, so that I can find exact matches for my sophisticated preferences and discover similar fragrances to ones I already love.

The user has access to detailed filters including specific notes (jasmine, sandalwood), perfumers, concentration levels, and price ranges. They can save search queries, compare fragrances side-by-side, and receive AI explanations for why certain fragrances are recommended.

### Collection-Based Discovery Story

As a fragrance collector, I want to search for fragrances that complement my existing collection and receive recommendations based on gaps in my fragrance wardrobe, so that I can strategically expand my collection with diverse, high-quality options.

The system analyzes the user's collection to identify scent profile gaps and suggests fragrances that add diversity. Advanced search includes rarity filters, vintage options, and collection completion suggestions with detailed rationale.

## Spec Scope

1. **Browse Page Implementation** - Dedicated fragrance discovery page with grid layout, search bar, and progressive filtering options
2. **Search Functionality** - AI-powered search with text queries, autocomplete, and natural language processing for scent descriptions
3. **Multi-Level Filtering System** - Progressive disclosure filters from beginner-friendly categories to advanced note-specific options
4. **Vector-Powered Recommendations** - Integration with existing pgvector database for similarity-based fragrance suggestions

1. Functional browse page at `/browse` with search and filtering capabilities that loads and displays fragrance results
2. Working search functionality that returns relevant results for text queries and integrates with the vector database
3. Multi-tier filtering system that adapts interface complexity based on user expertise level and successfully filters fragrance results
