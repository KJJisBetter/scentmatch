**Detailed workflow:** User clicks affiliate link → lands on homepage → understands value proposition within 5 seconds → starts quiz or browse → gets meaningful recommendations → feels confident about the platform → creates account or bookmarks for later.

### Fragrance Beginner
As a fragrance beginner, I want a smooth, guided experience that doesn't overwhelm me, so that I can discover my preferences without feeling intimidated by complex fragrance terminology.

**Detailed workflow:** User starts quiz → answers simple preference questions → receives personalized recommendations with clear explanations → can easily browse and filter results → finds sample purchasing options → feels confident to make first purchase.
