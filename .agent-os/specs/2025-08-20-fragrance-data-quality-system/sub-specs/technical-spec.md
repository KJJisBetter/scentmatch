# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-20-fragrance-data-quality-system/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Core Architecture Components

- **Fragrance Name Normalization Engine**: Automated system for detecting and correcting malformed names using industry-standard patterns and fuzzy matching algorithms
- **Canonical Product Database**: Structured schema separating canonical fragrances from variants, enabling clean data with comprehensive search coverage
- **Missing Product Intelligence System**: Intelligent handling of product-not-found scenarios with alternative suggestions and demand tracking
- **Data Quality Monitoring Pipeline**: Automated quality scoring, issue detection, and alerting system for proactive data management
- **Enhanced Search System**: Multi-stage search combining exact match, fuzzy text matching, and vector similarity for comprehensive coverage

### Database Schema Enhancements

**Canonical Fragrance System:**
- `fragrances_canonical` table with standardized naming and metadata
- `fragrance_variants` table tracking name variations and malformed entries
- PostgreSQL pg_trgm extension for fuzzy text matching
- Vector embeddings for semantic search capabilities

**Missing Product Tracking:**
- `missing_product_requests` table logging user searches for unavailable products
- Demand tracking and threshold-based sourcing workflow triggers
- Alternative product suggestion mapping

**Quality Monitoring:**
- `data_quality_scores` table tracking quality metrics over time
- Automated quality check results and issue tracking
- Performance metrics for search and recommendation accuracy

### API Enhancements

**Name Normalization API:**
- `POST /api/data-quality/normalize` - Normalize fragrance name input
- `GET /api/data-quality/variants` - Retrieve name variants for canonical product
- `POST /api/data-quality/report-issue` - Report data quality issues

**Missing Product Handling:**
- `POST /api/missing-products/log` - Log missing product search
- `GET /api/missing-products/alternatives` - Get alternative suggestions
- `POST /api/missing-products/notify` - Request notification when available

**Quality Monitoring:**
- `GET /api/data-quality/score` - Current overall quality score
- `GET /api/data-quality/issues` - Active quality issues requiring attention
- `POST /api/data-quality/run-checks` - Trigger manual quality assessment

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundation (Canonical System)**
- Implement canonical fragrance schema and migration tools
- Build name normalization engine with industry-standard patterns
- Create variant tracking system for existing malformed names
- Set up fuzzy matching indexes and search capabilities

**Phase 2: Intelligence Layer (Missing Products)**
- Implement missing product detection and logging
- Build alternative suggestion engine using vector similarity
- Create demand tracking and notification system
- Add intelligent search result enhancement

**Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Monitoring)**
- Build automated quality checking pipeline
- Implement scoring algorithms and alerting thresholds
- Create quality metrics dashboard and reporting
- Add continuous monitoring and improvement workflows

### Performance Requirements

- Name normalization: < 50ms per fragrance
- Fuzzy search queries: < 100ms for 10k+ products
- Vector similarity search: < 200ms for alternative suggestions
- Quality check pipeline: Complete database scan < 5 minutes
- Search result enhancement: < 150ms additional latency

### External Dependencies

**PostgreSQL Extensions:**
- `pg_trgm` for fuzzy text matching and similarity scoring
- `pgvector` for semantic search and product similarity
- Full-text search capabilities for enhanced text matching

**AI/ML Services:**
- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small for product embeddings (fallback: Voyage AI)
- Embedding generation for new products and similarity matching
- Cost optimization through caching and batch processing

### Security Considerations

- Input validation for all normalization and search endpoints
- Rate limiting on expensive operations (embedding generation, quality checks)
- Data integrity constraints preventing corrupt canonical mappings
- Access controls for data quality management interfaces
