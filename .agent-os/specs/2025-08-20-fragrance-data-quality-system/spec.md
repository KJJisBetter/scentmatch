# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Comprehensive Fragrance Data Quality System
> Created: 2025-08-20
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive fragrance data quality system that addresses critical launch-blocking issues: malformed fragrance names destroying professional credibility, missing popular fragrances causing user abandonment, and lack of systematic data quality monitoring. This system will transform ScentMatch from amateur-appearing to professional-grade through automated name normalization, intelligent missing product detection, and proactive quality assurance.

## User Stories

### Professional Fragrance Display

As a fragrance enthusiast visiting ScentMatch, I want to see properly formatted fragrance names like "Bleu de Chanel EDP" instead of "Bleu De EDP", so that I trust the platform has accurate and professional fragrance data.

**Detailed Workflow:**
User searches for Chanel fragrances → sees professionally formatted names → trusts platform credibility → continues browsing and potentially creates account. Current malformed names like "N05 Eau Premiere" (should be "Chanel No 5 Eau Premiere") immediately signal poor data quality and destroy trust.

### Missing Product Intelligence

As a user searching for popular fragrances, I want the system to intelligently handle missing products like "Coach For Me" by suggesting alternatives and tracking my request, so that I don't abandon the platform due to empty search results.

**Detailed Workflow:**
User searches for missing popular fragrance → system logs request and suggests similar alternatives → offers to notify when available → tracks demand for inventory planning. This converts potential abandonment into engagement opportunity.

### Data Quality Monitoring

As a product manager, I want automated data quality monitoring that detects malformed names, missing popular products, and data inconsistencies before users encounter them, so that we maintain professional standards and user trust.

**Detailed Workflow:**
System continuously monitors fragrance data → detects quality issues → alerts for manual review → applies automated fixes where possible → tracks quality metrics over time.

## Spec Scope

1. **Fragrance Name Normalization System** - Automated detection and correction of malformed fragrance names using industry-standard formatting rules
2. **Missing Product Detection & Management** - Intelligent handling of searches for products not in database with alternative suggestions and demand tracking  
3. **Data Quality Monitoring Pipeline** - Automated quality checks, scoring, and alerting for proactive data management
4. **Canonical Product Database** - Structured approach to handling product variants, duplicates, and naming conventions
5. **Search Enhancement** - Fuzzy matching and intelligent search to handle name variations and user input errors

## Out of Scope

- Complete fragrance database rebuild (gradual migration approach instead)
- Manual data entry interfaces (focus on automated solutions)
- Real-time inventory tracking with retailers (future enhancement)
- User-generated content moderation (separate system)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Professional fragrance names displayed throughout platform** - Users see "Bleu de Chanel EDP" instead of "Bleu De EDP", "Chanel No 5 Eau Premiere" instead of "N05 Eau Premiere"
2. **Intelligent missing product handling** - Searches for "Coach For Me" provide alternatives and capture demand instead of empty results
3. **Automated data quality pipeline** - System proactively detects and resolves data quality issues before they impact users
