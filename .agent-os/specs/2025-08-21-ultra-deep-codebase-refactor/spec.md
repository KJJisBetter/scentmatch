> Spec: Ultra-Deep Codebase Refactor - Eliminate 10,000+ Lines & Modernize Architecture  
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Perform a comprehensive codebase refactor to eliminate 40-60% of existing code (10,000+ lines) and modernize ScentMatch architecture using 2025 best practices including Next.js 15+ Server Actions, Zod schema validation, and modern component patterns. This initiative will achieve 300% performance improvement while reducing maintenance complexity and improving developer experience.

## User Stories

### Platform Performance Enhancement

As a **ScentMatch user**, I want to experience lightning-fast page loads and interactions, so that I can discover fragrances without waiting for slow responses or content loading delays.

**Workflow:** Users will experience sub-1.2s First Contentful Paint, instant navigation between pages through streaming architecture, and responsive AI recommendations that load progressively without blocking the interface.

### Developer Experience Modernization

As a **ScentMatch developer**, I want to work with modern, simplified code patterns that eliminate boilerplate and reduce maintenance overhead, so that I can ship features 3x faster with higher confidence.

**Workflow:** Developers will write less code to achieve the same functionality, benefit from comprehensive type inference through Zod schemas, and use proven 2025 patterns that eliminate the need for custom abstractions and complex state management.

### Architecture Simplification

As a **platform maintainer**, I want a drastically simplified codebase that eliminates unnecessary complexity and consolidates redundant systems, so that the platform becomes more reliable and easier to enhance.

**Workflow:** The platform will operate with 73% fewer API routes, 88% fewer type definitions, unified data patterns, and consolidated AI/ML systems that reduce the surface area for bugs while improving performance.

## Spec Scope

1. **Type System Consolidation** - Replace 2,472 type definitions with 200-300 Zod-inferred types for 88% reduction
2. **API Architecture Modernization** - Convert 24 API routes to Server Actions, retaining only 8 essential endpoints
3. **Component Library Migration** - Complete shadcn/ui adoption to eliminate 1,000+ lines of custom components
4. **Streaming Architecture Implementation** - Add Suspense boundaries and progressive loading for 60% perceived performance improvement
5. **Database Client Unification** - Standardize on single @supabase/ssr pattern across all data operations
6. **AI System Finalization** - Complete UnifiedRecommendationEngine migration and remove legacy AI utilities
7. **Bundle Optimization** - Achieve 50% bundle size reduction through modern tree shaking and code splitting

## Out of Scope

- Complete UI/UX redesign (maintaining existing design system)
- Migration to different framework or database platform
- New feature development during refactor period
- Breaking changes to public API contracts
- User data migrations or schema changes
- Third-party integration modifications

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Performance Metrics Achievement** - First Contentful Paint <1.2s, Time to Interactive <2.5s, all Core Web Vitals green
2. **Code Reduction Verification** - Demonstrable 40-60% line reduction with maintained functionality through comprehensive test suite
3. **Modern Architecture Validation** - All major pages use Suspense boundaries, Server Actions handle data mutations, and type safety achieved through schema inference
