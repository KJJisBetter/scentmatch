## User Stories

### Story 1: New User Discovery Journey
**As an 18-year-old fragrance beginner who "heard Sauvage is popular"**  
I want to explore recommendations and learn about fragrances without being forced into account creation, so that I can build confidence and understanding before making purchase decisions.

**Workflow**: Take quiz → Get personalized recommendations → Explore and compare → Learn about concentrations/notes → Naturally convert to account when ready to save favorites.

I want pages to load quickly without errors and see complete fragrance information, so that I can trust the platform and have a smooth browsing experience.

**Workflow**: Browse fragrances → See complete data (no "Unknown" families) → Experience fast page loads → No 404 errors or broken resources.

### Story 3: Educational & Social Context
**As a fragrance beginner**  
I want to understand what I'm looking at and get social validation for my choices, so that I can make confident decisions that fit my age group and lifestyle.

**Workflow**: See fragrance → Get simple explanations → Understand peer context → Feel confident about choice → Share with friends.
