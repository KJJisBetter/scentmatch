## 2025-08-14: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

ScentMatch will be an AI-powered fragrance discovery platform targeting beginners, enthusiasts, and collectors with personalized recommendations, collection management, and sample-first purchasing approach prioritizing travel sizes and samples over full bottles.

### Context

The fragrance market lacks accessible, personalized discovery tools. Current options overwhelm beginners with choice while failing to provide intelligent recommendations based on individual preferences. Most platforms push expensive full-bottle purchases without adequate testing opportunities.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional E-commerce Fragrance Store**
   - Pros: Proven business model, direct revenue from sales
   - Cons: Highly competitive market, lacks differentiation, perpetuates expensive trial-and-error

2. **Social Review Platform Only**
   - Pros: Lower development complexity, community-driven content
   - Cons: Limited monetization, lacks personalization, doesn't solve discovery problem

3. **AI-First Sample Discovery Platform (Chosen)**
   - Pros: Unique value proposition, solves real user pain points, scalable AI differentiation
   - Cons: Complex AI development, requires significant fragrance data

### Rationale

Key factors in decision:

- Market gap: No existing platform combines AI personalization with sample-first approach
- User pain points: Expensive fragrance discovery process creates barrier to entry
- Technology opportunity: AI can provide explanatory recommendations humans cannot scale
- Business model: Affiliate revenue from samples/travel sizes more sustainable than competing on full bottles
- Target market: Underserved beginners need guidance, enthusiasts want intelligent expansion

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Unique market positioning with AI-powered personalization
- Solves real user problems around expensive fragrance discovery
- Scalable business model through affiliate partnerships
- Educational approach builds user trust and loyalty

**Negative:**

- Complex AI development requirements
- Dependency on fragrance data quality and availability
- Need to establish affiliate partnerships for monetization
- Higher technical complexity than simple e-commerce approach

## 2025-08-14: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Selected Next.js 15+ with TypeScript, Shadcn/ui, and Vercel deployment for modern, fast, clean user experience meeting "golden standard" requirements.

### Context

User specifically requested "Modern, Fast, Clean, and Smooth" technology stack with "up to day golden standard" and Shadcn/ui components. Need to balance cutting-edge technology with stability and team productivity.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Ruby on Rails (Global Default)**
   - Pros: Team familiarity, rapid development, proven patterns
   - Cons: Doesn't meet "modern golden standard" requirement, less optimal for AI integration

2. **Next.js + TypeScript (Chosen)**
   - Pros: Modern React patterns, excellent performance, great AI SDK ecosystem, Vercel optimization
   - Cons: Newer technology, potential learning curve

### Rationale

- User explicitly requested modern stack and Shadcn/ui
- AI integration requires robust frontend for complex recommendation interfaces
- Next.js App Router provides optimal performance for content-heavy application
- Vercel ecosystem offers integrated deployment, analytics, and AI tools
- TypeScript ensures code quality for complex AI logic

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Meets user's specific technology requirements
- Optimal performance for AI-heavy application
- Modern developer experience and tooling
- Strong ecosystem for rapid feature development

**Negative:**

- Deviation from global Ruby on Rails standards
- Team may need Next.js learning curve
- More complex initial setup than traditional frameworks
