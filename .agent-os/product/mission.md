## The Problem

### Fragrance Discovery is Overwhelming and Expensive

The fragrance market offers thousands of options with limited ways to discover what you'll actually enjoy. Most people rely on in-store testing with biased sales staff or expensive blind purchases that often disappoint.

**Our Solution:** AI-powered personalized recommendations based on your preferences, collection, and scent profile analysis.

### No Reliable Way to Test Before Committing

Traditional fragrance shopping forces expensive full-bottle purchases without adequate testing opportunities, leading to regret purchases and wasted money.

**Our Solution:** Prioritize sample and travel sizes with affiliate links, plus guided blind testing experiences.

### Lack of Objective Reviews and Comparisons

Fragrance reviews are subjective and scattered across platforms, making it difficult to get reliable, unbiased information about scents.

**Our Solution:** Aggregate video reviews, fragrance battles, and social proof from YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms with scoring systems.
