# Spec Summary (Lite)

Completely rebuild the fragrance catalog using the complete `fragrances-final-2025.json` dataset (2,017 fragrances) to replace the incomplete current dataset (1,400 fragrances). This fixes major data gaps in popular brands (missing 27 Dior, 28 Chanel, 35 Tom Ford fragrances) and implements popularity-based organization instead of alphabetical sorting.
