# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: AI-Enhanced Collection-Driven Recommendation System
> Created: 2025-08-16
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive AI recommendation engine that uses user collections as the primary data source for intelligent fragrance recommendations, with automated categorization, gap analysis, visual insights, and smart organization features.

## User Stories

### Collection-Driven Intelligence

As a fragrance enthusiast, I want the AI to analyze my collection to understand my preferences, so that future recommendations are highly personalized and accurate to my taste profile.

The AI analyzes fragrance notes, brands, price points, seasons, and occasions from existing collection items to build a comprehensive preference model. Users receive detailed explanations of why each recommendation matches their demonstrated preferences, creating transparency and trust in the AI's reasoning.

### Smart Collection Organization

As a user building my fragrance collection, I want the AI to automatically categorize my fragrances and suggest organizational improvements, so that I can better understand and manage my collection.

The system automatically categorizes fragrances by scent families, occasions, seasons, and intensity levels. Users can override AI suggestions with manual organization while the AI learns from these preferences to improve future recommendations.

### Gap Analysis and Collection Insights

As a collector, I want to understand what's missing from my collection and receive strategic recommendations for expanding my collection, so that I can build a well-rounded fragrance wardrobe.

The AI identifies gaps in scent profiles, missing seasonal options, occasion-specific needs, and suggests strategic additions with detailed reasoning about how each recommendation complements the existing collection.

## Spec Scope

1. **Collection Analysis Engine** - Deep analysis of user's existing fragrances to understand preference patterns and build taste profiles
2. **Intelligent Recommendation System** - Advanced recommendation engine that prioritizes collection-based insights over generic popularity
3. **Automated Collection Categorization** - Smart organization of fragrances with manual override capabilities
4. **Gap Analysis and Strategic Insights** - Identification of collection gaps with reasoned suggestions for expansion
5. **Visual Analytics Dashboard** - Rich visual insights showing collection breakdown, preference trends, and recommendation reasoning

## Out of Scope

- Real-time chat interface (moved to backlog)
- Seasonal/mood-based automated emails (moved to backlog)
- Advanced machine learning model training (using existing OpenAI/Voyage infrastructure)
- Social features or community recommendations

## Expected Deliverable

1. AI analyzes existing collections and provides detailed preference insights visible in collection dashboard
2. Recommendation engine prioritizes collection-based matching over generic algorithms with detailed reasoning
3. Collection items are automatically categorized with manual override options working seamlessly
4. Gap analysis appears in collection dashboard showing strategic expansion opportunities with explanations
5. Visual insights display collection breakdowns, preference patterns, and recommendation reasoning throughout the app
