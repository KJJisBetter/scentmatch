# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Complete Database API Integration
> Created: 2025-08-19
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Complete the full database integration by replacing all JSON fallback systems with proper Supabase database functions and ensure all API routes are fully operational with the PostgreSQL backend. This will eliminate the mixed data sources and create a unified, production-ready data layer.

## User Stories

### Complete API Functionality

As a user of the ScentMatch platform, I want all search, recommendation, and quiz features to work seamlessly with the database, so that I get consistent, real-time data and my interactions are properly stored and analyzed.

The complete flow should work from quiz completion through personalized recommendations, with all data persisted in Supabase for future AI learning and personalization.

### Developer Experience

As a developer maintaining ScentMatch, I want all API routes to use the database consistently, so that there are no data synchronization issues, fallback logic complexities, or testing complications from mixed data sources.

## Spec Scope

1. **Quiz System Database Integration** - Replace JSON-based quiz analysis with Supabase database functions
2. **API Route Database Migration** - Convert all remaining JSON fallbacks to database queries
3. **Database Function Activation** - Enable and test all Supabase RPC functions for recommendations
4. **Error Handling Standardization** - Implement consistent database error handling across all routes
5. **TypeScript Integration Fixes** - Resolve type mismatches preventing AI route activation

## Out of Scope

- Adding new AI features or algorithms
- UI/UX changes or frontend modifications
- Performance optimization beyond basic database indexing
- New database schema changes (work with existing structure)

## Expected Deliverable

1. All API routes (`/api/search`, `/api/quiz/*`, `/api/fragrances/*`) fully operational with database
2. Quiz system stores and retrieves data from Supabase instead of JSON files
3. All Supabase RPC functions properly called and returning expected data
