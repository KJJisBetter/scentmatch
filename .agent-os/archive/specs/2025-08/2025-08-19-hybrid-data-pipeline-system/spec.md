# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Hybrid Data Pipeline System
> Created: 2025-08-19
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a sophisticated 3-phase hybrid data pipeline that combines Kaggle's comprehensive fragrance dataset (24K fragrances) with targeted Fragrantica scraping to build the world's best fragrance database. This system will filter 24,064 fragrances down to the top 2,000 most relevant entries while maintaining ongoing intelligence gathering for new releases.

## User Stories

### Data Pipeline Engineer Story

As a data pipeline engineer, I want to process and filter large fragrance datasets efficiently, so that I can deliver high-quality, curated fragrance data to the ScentMatch platform while maintaining ethical scraping practices and sustainable data collection.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Load and analyze Kaggle's 24K fragrance dataset using priority scoring algorithm
2. Filter down to top 2,000 fragrances based on rating, reviews, brand prestige, and recency
3. Identify gaps in popular fragrances through trend analysis
4. Execute respectful, rate-limited scraping for missing data
5. Set up continuous monitoring for new fragrance releases
6. Import processed data into Supabase with proper normalization

### ScentMatch Platform Story

As the ScentMatch platform, I want access to a curated, up-to-date fragrance database, so that I can provide users with accurate recommendations based on the most popular and relevant fragrances in the market.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Receive clean, normalized fragrance data with standardized fields
2. Integrate with existing Supabase schema and embeddings pipeline
3. Access real-time updates for new popular fragrance releases
4. Benefit from quality-assured data (all entries >3.5 rating, >100 reviews)
5. Utilize comprehensive coverage of luxury brands and modern classics

### Database Administrator Story

As a database administrator, I want a maintainable data pipeline with monitoring and quality controls, so that the fragrance database remains current, accurate, and performant over time.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Monitor weekly automated data collection processes
2. Receive notifications for new fragrance additions requiring manual review
3. Track data quality metrics and performance indicators
4. Manage database maintenance tasks and optimization
5. Ensure compliance with ethical scraping standards

## Spec Scope

1. **Kaggle Data Processing** - Filter and clean 24,064 fragrances to top 2,000 using multi-factor priority scoring algorithm
2. **Gap Analysis System** - Identify missing popular fragrances through trend monitoring and social media analysis
3. **Ethical Scraping Framework** - Implement respectful, rate-limited Fragrantica scraping with comprehensive compliance measures
4. **Database Integration** - Seamless import into Supabase with proper data normalization and embedding generation
5. **Continuous Monitoring** - Weekly automated intelligence gathering for new releases and trending fragrances

## Out of Scope

- Real-time scraping (weekly batch processing only)
- Full Fragrantica database replication (targeted gap-filling only)
- Alternative fragrance website integrations beyond Fragrantica
- Manual data entry or curation workflows
- Historical fragrance data beyond what's available in current sources

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Working Data Pipeline** - Complete 3-phase pipeline that transforms 24K Kaggle entries into 2K curated database records
2. **Automated Monitoring System** - Weekly cron job that identifies and processes new popular fragrances automatically
3. **Clean Repository Structure** - Organized scripts, configuration files, and proper gitignore for production deployment
