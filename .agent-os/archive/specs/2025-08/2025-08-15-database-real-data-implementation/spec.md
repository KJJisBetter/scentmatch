# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Database Implementation with Real Fragrance Data
> Created: 2025-08-15
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive database schema and data import system using real fragrance data from `/data/fragrances.json` instead of synthetic data. This includes proper technology research, stable version usage, and QA-driven testing approach.

## User Stories

### Fragrance Discovery Foundation

As a **fragrance enthusiast**, I want to browse and search real fragrances with authentic data, so that I can discover fragrances based on actual Fragrantica information including real brand names, ratings, notes, and community reviews.

**Detailed Workflow**: User visits the platform and can immediately search through real fragrances with accurate metadata, brand information, and user ratings sourced from the actual fragrance community.

### Data Integrity Assurance  

As a **product owner**, I want all fragrance data to come from the curated JSON file, so that users get authentic, reliable information instead of synthetic placeholders that provide no real value.

**Detailed Workflow**: Database seeding process reads from `/data/fragrances.json`, validates and imports all 1,467 fragrance records while preserving original brand names, ratings, URLs, and metadata.

### Technology Stability

As a **development team**, I want all technologies to be properly researched for stability, so that we avoid build failures and production issues from using experimental or incompatible versions.

**Detailed Workflow**: Before implementing any technology, research current stable versions, verify compatibility matrices, and use established, production-ready configurations.

## Spec Scope

1. **Database Schema Design** - Complete schema for users, fragrances, brands, and collections using real data structure
2. **JSON Data Import** - Robust import system that processes the 1,467 fragrance records from the provided JSON file  
3. **Technology Research** - Proper research and stable version selection for all dependencies (PostCSS v3, TailwindCSS stable, etc.)
4. **QA-Driven Testing** - QA tester creates all test specifications, other agents implement the tests
5. **Build Stability** - Fix existing PostCSS v4 incompatibility and ensure clean builds

## Out of Scope

- Authentication system (separate spec)
- Frontend UI components (separate spec) 
- AI recommendation engine (future phase)
- User-generated content features

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Database** - Complete PostgreSQL schema with pgvector extension, populated with real fragrance data
2. **Clean Build Process** - Application builds successfully without PostCSS or other configuration errors
3. **Comprehensive Tests** - Full test suite designed by QA tester and implemented by appropriate specialists
