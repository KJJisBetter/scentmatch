# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: AI-Powered Enhancement System
> Created: 2025-08-18
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive, vendor-agnostic AI enhancement system that transforms ScentMatch into a fully AI-powered fragrance discovery platform. This system will leverage multiple AI providers to avoid lock-in while providing automated embedding generation, intelligent recommendations, and real-time personalization that learns from user behavior and collection data.

## User Stories

### Intelligent Fragrance Discovery

As a fragrance enthusiast, I want AI-powered search that understands my intent even when I describe fragrances in natural language like "something fresh for summer mornings" or "a sophisticated evening scent like Tom Ford but more affordable", so that I discover fragrances that match my specific needs and preferences.

**Workflow**: User enters natural language query → AI embeddings find semantically similar fragrances → Results ranked by personal preference model → Explanations provided for each recommendation → User feedback improves future suggestions

### Automated Preference Learning

As a user building my fragrance collection, I want the AI to automatically learn my preferences from my ratings, purchases, and browsing behavior without explicit configuration, so that recommendations become increasingly personalized and accurate over time.

**Workflow**: User interacts with fragrances (rating, saving, viewing) → AI analyzes patterns and updates user preference model → Collection insights generated → Future recommendations adapted → Preference shifts detected and handled

### Smart Collection Analysis

As a fragrance collector, I want AI-powered insights about my collection including scent family analysis, seasonal recommendations, gap identification, and discovery of fragrances that complement my existing collection, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions and optimize my fragrance wardrobe.

**Workflow**: User connects collection → AI analyzes scent profiles and patterns → Insights generated about preferences and gaps → Seasonal/occasion-based recommendations → Collection optimization suggestions provided

## Spec Scope

1. **Multi-Provider AI Architecture** - Vendor-agnostic system supporting Voyage AI, OpenAI, and future providers with automatic fallback
2. **Automated Embedding Pipeline** - Real-time embedding generation when new fragrances are added via database triggers and Edge Functions
3. **Intelligent Recommendation Engine** - Hybrid system combining vector similarity, collaborative filtering, and contextual factors
4. **Real-time Personalization** - User preference models that update automatically based on interactions and feedback
5. **Natural Language Processing** - AI-powered search understanding intent, mood, and contextual fragrance needs
6. **Collection Intelligence** - Advanced analytics providing insights, gaps, and optimization recommendations for user collections
7. **Embedding Regeneration System** - Batch processing to regenerate all embeddings after database cleanup with progress tracking

## Out of Scope

- Visual fragrance analysis (image recognition)
- Voice-based fragrance discovery
- Social media integration for fragrance trends
- Inventory management for retailers
- Price prediction algorithms

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Complete AI Architecture** - Production-ready multi-provider AI system with automatic failover and cost optimization
2. **Automated Embedding Generation** - New fragrances automatically generate embeddings within minutes of database insertion
3. **Intelligent Search Experience** - Natural language search returning contextually relevant results with AI explanations
4. **Personalized Recommendations** - User-specific fragrance suggestions that improve with usage and explain reasoning
5. **Collection Analytics Dashboard** - AI-powered insights showing collection patterns, preferences, and recommendations
6. **Regenerated Database Embeddings** - All existing fragrances have fresh, high-quality embeddings using latest Voyage AI models
