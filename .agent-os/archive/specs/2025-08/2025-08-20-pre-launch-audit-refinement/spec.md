## Overview

Comprehensive pre-launch audit and refinement to prepare ScentMatch for the August 21st launch. This includes implementing browse page pagination, fixing 404 errors, conducting a complete design audit, resolving quiz bugs, and applying final polish to ensure a professional user experience.

## User Stories

### Polish and Perfection

As a **new user**, I want to encounter a polished, professional experience without broken elements or confusing navigation, so that I trust the platform and feel confident using it.

The user should experience seamless navigation with all pages working correctly, proper pagination for browsing fragrances, and a quiz system that works reliably without bugs or errors.

### Comprehensive Browsing Experience

As a **fragrance enthusiast**, I want to browse through the entire fragrance catalog efficiently with pagination, so that I can discover new scents without performance issues or awkward navigation.

The browse page should handle large datasets gracefully with proper pagination controls, loading states, and smooth transitions between pages.

### Reliable Quiz Experience

As a **fragrance beginner**, I want the personality quiz to work perfectly and give me accurate recommendations, so that I can trust the platform's AI-powered suggestions.

The quiz should be bug-free, provide consistent results, and successfully transfer data when creating an account.

## Spec Scope

1. **Browse Page Pagination** - Implement server-side pagination with proper controls and loading states
2. **404 Error Resolution** - Identify and fix all broken links and missing pages
3. **Comprehensive Design Audit** - Review every UI element for consistency, spacing, and visual quality
4. **Quiz Bug Fixes** - Resolve all known quiz issues including data transfer and recommendation accuracy
5. **Final Polish Pass** - Address all visual inconsistencies, broken layouts, and UX friction points

## Out of Scope

2. All navigation paths working without 404 errors
3. Comprehensive design audit report with all issues resolved
4. Quiz system working reliably without bugs or data transfer issues
