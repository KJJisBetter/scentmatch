# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement Linear MCP integration to systematically track, prioritize, and resolve critical pre-launch issues through automated project management workflows. This establishes proper issue tracking for launch-blocking problems (SCE-31: fragrance 404s, SCE-33: hide dev pages, SCE-32: dashboard errors) ensuring systematic resolution and launch readiness visibility.
