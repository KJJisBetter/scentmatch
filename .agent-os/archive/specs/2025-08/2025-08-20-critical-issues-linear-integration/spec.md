# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Critical Issues Linear Integration
> Created: 2025-08-20
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement Linear MCP integration to systematically track, prioritize, and resolve critical pre-launch issues through proper project management workflows. This feature will establish automated issue management, priority-based workflows, and ensure no critical issues are overlooked during the August 21st launch.

## User Stories

### Automated Issue Tracking

As a product manager, I want to integrate Linear MCP with our development workflow, so that critical issues are automatically tracked, prioritized, and assigned without manual overhead.

**Workflow:** Critical issues discovered during testing are automatically created in Linear with proper priority labels (üö® Launch Critical, üî• Pre-Launch, ‚≠ê Nice-to-Have), assigned to appropriate team members, and tracked through resolution with automated status updates.

### Systematic Critical Issue Resolution  

As a development team, I want a structured approach to resolving critical issues, so that we can systematically address launch-blocking problems without missing any critical items.

**Workflow:** Each critical issue gets proper documentation, investigation steps, testing verification, and completion tracking through Linear's project management features, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

### Launch Readiness Dashboard

As a product owner, I want real-time visibility into critical issue resolution progress, so that I can make informed decisions about launch readiness and timeline.

**Workflow:** Linear integration provides automated reporting on critical issue status, resolution progress, and launch readiness metrics through organized project views and automated status updates.

## Spec Scope

1. **Linear MCP Integration Setup** - Connect development workflow with Linear project management system
2. **Critical Issue Automated Tracking** - Auto-create and manage issues for SCE-31, SCE-33, SCE-32
3. **Priority-Based Workflow Management** - Implement structured approach to issue resolution based on launch impact
4. **Systematic Resolution Process** - Establish investigation, testing, and completion workflows for each critical issue
5. **Launch Readiness Monitoring** - Real-time tracking of critical issue resolution progress

## Out of Scope

- Linear account setup and team onboarding (assumed already configured)
- Non-critical issue backlog management
- Long-term project planning beyond launch readiness
- Custom Linear workflow configuration beyond standard issue management

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Linear MCP integration working** - Development workflow automatically creates and updates Linear issues
2. **Critical issues properly tracked** - SCE-31, SCE-33, SCE-32 documented and managed in Linear with correct priorities  
3. **Systematic resolution workflows established** - Each critical issue has investigation steps, testing requirements, and completion criteria
