- **Purpose:** Document investigation steps, testing results, and resolution details
- **Parameters:** issueId, body (markdown-formatted progress updates)
- **Automated Comments:** Testing results, resolution verification, completion confirmation

### Critical Issue Workflow Endpoints

#### Issue Status Tracking
- **MCP Function:** `mcp__linear-server__list_issues`
- **Purpose:** Query current critical issue status for launch readiness assessment

## Integration Workflow Processes

### Automatic Issue Creation Workflow
1. Critical issue discovered during testing/development
2. Automated priority assessment based on launch impact
3. Linear issue creation with proper priority, labels, and team assignment
4. Notification and assignment to appropriate team member

### Resolution Verification Workflow  
1. Issue resolution claimed by developer
2. Automated testing verification of fix in live environment
3. Linear issue status update with test results documentation
4. Final completion confirmation and issue closure

### Launch Readiness Assessment
1. Query all issues with launch-blocking and pre-launch labels
2. Calculate resolution percentage for critical path issues
3. Generate launch readiness report with blocking issue details
4. Automated status updates for stakeholder visibility
