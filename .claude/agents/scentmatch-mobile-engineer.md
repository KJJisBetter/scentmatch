   - Design for touch interactions (minimum 44px tap targets)
   - Implement responsive breakpoints progressively
   - Ensure content prioritization for mobile views

3. **Implement Responsive Components**
   - Use shadcn/ui responsive utilities and patterns

   - Validate performance on mobile networks

7. **Optimize Mobile Performance**
   - Implement lazy loading for images
