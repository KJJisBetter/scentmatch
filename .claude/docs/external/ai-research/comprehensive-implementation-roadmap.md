- **Missing Advanced Features:** No graph relationships, multi-resolution search, or contextual bandits
- **Limited Real-Time Learning:** Basic preference updates without sophisticated adaptation

## Technology Enhancement Plan

### 1. Multi-Armed Bandit Implementation (Priority: HIGH 🔴)

**Current Gap:** Static algorithm weights leading to suboptimal recommendations
**Solution:** Thompson Sampling with contextual bandits

#### Implementation Details
```sql
-- Bandit state tracking table
CREATE TABLE bandit_algorithms (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  algorithm_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  alpha FLOAT DEFAULT 1.0,  -- Success count + 1
  beta FLOAT DEFAULT 1.0,   -- Failure count + 1
  context_hash TEXT,
  last_updated TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  metadata JSONB
);

-- Recommendation feedback tracking
CREATE TABLE recommendation_feedback (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  fragrance_id UUID REFERENCES fragrances(id),
  algorithm_used TEXT,
  action TEXT CHECK (action IN ('view', 'click', 'add_to_collection', 'purchase')),
  reward FLOAT,
  context JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Expected Benefits
- **15-20% improvement** in recommendation click-through rates
- **Automatic optimization** reducing need for manual A/B testing
- **Real-time adaptation** to user behavior changes
- **Contextual personalization** based on time, season, mood

#### Implementation Timeline: 2-3 weeks

### 2. Matryoshka Embeddings for Performance (Priority: HIGH 🔴)

**Current Gap:** Single 2048-dimension embeddings causing performance bottlenecks
**Solution:** Multi-resolution embeddings with progressive search

#### Implementation Strategy
```sql
-- Multi-resolution embedding storage
ALTER TABLE fragrances 
ADD COLUMN embedding_256 vector(256),
ADD COLUMN embedding_512 vector(512),
ADD COLUMN embedding_1024 vector(1024);

-- Optimized indexes for each resolution
CREATE INDEX idx_fragrances_embedding_256_hnsw 
ON fragrances USING hnsw (embedding_256 vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);

CREATE INDEX idx_fragrances_embedding_512_hnsw 
ON fragrances USING hnsw (embedding_512 vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 24, ef_construction = 128);

-- Progressive search function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION progressive_search(
  query_256 vector(256),
  query_512 vector(512),
  query_2048 vector(2048),
  stage1_candidates int DEFAULT 1000,
  stage2_candidates int DEFAULT 100,
  final_results int DEFAULT 10
) RETURNS TABLE(fragrance_id UUID, similarity FLOAT);
```

#### Expected Benefits
- **14x faster search speeds** through progressive filtering
- **75% reduction in memory usage** for common queries
- **83% reduction in computation costs** for similarity calculations
- **Maintained accuracy** with proper multi-stage design

#### Implementation Timeline: 3-4 weeks

### 3. Graph Neural Networks for Discovery (Priority: MEDIUM 🟡)

**Current Gap:** No relationship modeling between fragrances, users, and attributes
**Solution:** Heterogeneous graph with GraphSAGE and attention mechanisms

#### Graph Architecture Design
```sql
-- Install Apache AGE extension for graph capabilities
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS age;

-- Graph edge relationships
CREATE TABLE fragrance_relationships (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  source_fragrance_id UUID REFERENCES fragrances(id),
  target_fragrance_id UUID REFERENCES fragrances(id),
  relationship_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'similar', 'complement', 'substitute'
  weight FLOAT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1.0,
  confidence FLOAT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.5,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User-fragrance interaction graph
CREATE TABLE user_fragrance_graph (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  fragrance_id UUID REFERENCES fragrances(id),
  interaction_strength FLOAT NOT NULL,
  interaction_type VARCHAR(50),
  temporal_weight FLOAT DEFAULT 1.0,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Expected Benefits
- **30-50% improvement** in recommendation diversity
- **Discovery of non-obvious connections** between fragrances
- **Community detection** for user taste clusters
- **Temporal preference evolution** tracking

#### Implementation Timeline: 4-6 weeks

### 4. Vector Database Optimization (Priority: MEDIUM 🟡)

**Current Issues:** Suboptimal index configuration and query performance
**Solution:** HNSW index optimization and specialized search strategies

#### Database Optimizations
```sql
-- Drop existing IVFFlat indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS fragrances_embedding_idx;

-- Create optimized HNSW indexes
CREATE INDEX fragrances_embedding_hnsw_general 
ON fragrances USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 32, ef_construction = 200, ef_search = 100);

-- Specialized indexes for filtered searches
CREATE INDEX fragrances_embedding_popular_hnsw 
ON fragrances USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WHERE rating_value >= 4.0 AND rating_count >= 50
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 100);

CREATE INDEX fragrances_embedding_recent_hnsw 
ON fragrances USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'
WITH (m = 24, ef_construction = 150);
```

#### Expected Benefits
- **60% reduction** in search latency (500ms → 200ms)
- **Better query plan optimization** for filtered searches
- **Improved concurrent query handling**
- **Reduced memory usage** through optimized parameters

#### Implementation Timeline: 1-2 weeks
