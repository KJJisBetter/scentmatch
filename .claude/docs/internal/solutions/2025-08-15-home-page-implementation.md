- **Mobile-first responsive design** scaling from 375px to 1920px+

- **Typography**: Playfair Display serif for headlines, Inter for body text
- **Color scheme**: Plum (primary), cream (base), gold (accent) brand colors

### Task 6.3: Feature Highlight Sections ✅
- **Three-column layout** showcasing core differentiators:
  1. **AI-Powered Personalization** (Plum theme) - analyzes collections, learns preferences
  2. **Sample-First Discovery** (Gold theme) - $3-15 samples vs $50-200 bottles
  3. **Interactive Testing** (Cream theme) - blind testing experiences
- **Responsive grid**: 1 column mobile → 2 columns tablet → 3 columns desktop
- **Interactive cards** with hover effects and scaling animations
- **Icon integration**: Sparkles, TestTube, Heart icons with gradient backgrounds

### Task 6.4: Call-to-Action and Navigation ✅

- **Touch-optimized interactions**: proper spacing, accessible tap targets
- **Mobile navigation component** with overlay and body scroll lock
- **Flexible typography scaling**: responsive text sizes across all breakpoints

### Task 6.6: Core Web Vitals Optimization ✅
