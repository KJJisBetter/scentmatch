/**
 * Educational Quality Test Summary:
 * 
 * ✅ BABY-TALK ELIMINATION:
 * - Identifies and rejects patronizing language
 * - Penalizes phrases like "like you wanted", "works for", "perfect for you"
 * - Requires educational content over simple statements
 * 
 * ✅ EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
 * - Must teach fragrance concepts (top notes, scent families, performance)
 * - Must explain fragrance behavior and characteristics
 * - Must make meaningful comparisons with technical reasoning
 * - Must stay within word count while being informative
 * 
 * ✅ PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY:
 * - Beginner: Basic concepts with clear explanations
 * - Intermediate: Technical interactions and performance details
 * - Advanced: Expert analysis with specific ingredients and chemistry
 * 
 * 🎯 RESULT: Explanations now teach fragrance knowledge while staying concise,
 * treating users as intelligent people who can learn rather than babies to patronize
