3. **Authentication**: Configure email/password provider with security settings
4. **Email System**: Setup email templates and SMTP configuration
5. **Environment**: Configure environment variables and redirect URLs
6. **Client Integration**: Set up @supabase/ssr client in Next.js application
7. **Security**: Implement RLS policies and validate connection security
8. **Testing**: Run all test cases and document results

### Configuration Files to Create
- [ ] `lib/supabase/client.ts` - Client-side Supabase client
- [ ] `lib/supabase/server.ts` - Server-side Supabase client  
- [ ] `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` - Authentication middleware
- [ ] `.env.local.example` - Environment variable template
- [ ] `scripts/database/setup-extensions.sql` - Extension installation script

### Testing Implementation Notes

**QA Testing Specialist Notes:**
This specification provides comprehensive coverage of Supabase setup requirements with clear pass/fail criteria. The backend engineer should implement these tests incrementally, validating each component before proceeding to the next. Focus on security and connectivity validation as these are foundational for all subsequent development work.
