curl -X POST https://api.scentmatch.com/v1/feature-flags/bottom_navigation_v2/disable \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# 2. Verify rollback
curl https://api.scentmatch.com/v1/feature-flags/bottom_navigation_v2/status

# 3. Alert team
slack-notify "#incidents" "ðŸš¨ Emergency rollback executed for bottom_navigation_v2"
```

### Controlled Rollback (< 15 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Reduce traffic allocation
curl -X PATCH https://api.scentmatch.com/v1/feature-flags/bottom_navigation_v2 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"allocation": {"treatment": 0, "control": 100}}'

# 2. Monitor for 10 minutes
./scripts/monitor-rollback.sh bottom_navigation_v2

# 3. Full disable if issues persist
curl -X POST https://api.scentmatch.com/v1/feature-flags/bottom_navigation_v2/disable
```
