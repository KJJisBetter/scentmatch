## Conclusion

The ScentMatch platform has excellent underlying architecture and design quality. The homepage demonstrates professional grade implementation that would impress affiliate partners. However, the critical user flows (browse, auth, quiz search) have blocking technical issues that must be resolved before any affiliate launch.

The good news is these appear to be configuration/component structure issues rather than fundamental architecture problems, suggesting they can be resolved relatively quickly with focused technical fixes.
