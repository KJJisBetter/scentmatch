## Technical Architecture

### Engagement Phases
1. **Exploration** - Immediate results access, no barriers
2. **Investment** - Progressive value building through interaction
3. **Conversion** - Natural account creation prompts
4. **Retention** - Post-conversion value confirmation

### Investment Score Calculation
```typescript
// Weighted engagement events build investment score (0-1)
const engagementWeights = {
  fragrance_detail_view: 0.15,
  favorite_added: 0.25,
  sample_interest: 0.30,
  quiz_result_share: 0.20,
  comparison_view: 0.10,
  time_spent: 0.05 // per 30 seconds
};
```

### Natural Conversion Triggers
- **High Engagement:** After favorites + detailed exploration
- **Extended Time:** 3+ minutes invested
- **Share Intent:** User attempts to share results
- **Comparison Behavior:** Multiple fragrance comparisons

## Results & Metrics
