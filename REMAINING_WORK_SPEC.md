## Phase 1: Technical Foundation & Performance (2-4 weeks)

### üîß **Critical Issue 1: TypeScript Compliance & Code Quality**

**Current State:** 40+ TypeScript errors in non-MVP features
**Impact:** Development velocity, code reliability, production stability
**Priority:** P1 - High

**Affected Areas:**

components/collection/collection-data-table.tsx - Duplicate identifiers

// Service Layer Types (12 errors)
lib/services/ - SupabaseClient vs Promise<SupabaseClient> mismatches
lib/services/ - Database query type inconsistencies

// Social Feature Types (5 errors)
components/social/ - ShareableData interface mismatches
```

### ‚ö° **Critical Issue 2: API Pattern Consolidation (SCE-106)**

**Current State:** Mixed API routes vs Server Actions causing maintenance complexity
**Impact:** Developer confusion, inconsistent patterns, performance bottlenecks
**Priority:** P1 - High

**Architecture Analysis:**

```
‚ùå Current Mixed Patterns:
/app/api/quiz/route.ts (329 lines - heavy AI processing)
/app/api/search/route.ts (477 lines - complex search logic)
/lib/actions/collections.ts (Server Actions for same domain)

‚úÖ Target Unified Pattern:
/lib/actions/ (all user interactions)
/app/api/ (only external webhooks/integrations)
```

**Migration Strategy:**

1. **Quiz Server Action Migration (Week 2.1 - 8 hours)**

   ```typescript
   // Move /app/api/quiz/route.ts ‚Üí /lib/actions/quiz.ts
   export async function analyzeQuizResponses(responses: QuizResponse[]);
   export async function generateQuizRecommendations(sessionToken: string);
   ```

2. **Search Server Action Migration (Week 2.2 - 6 hours)**

   ```typescript
   // Move /app/api/search/route.ts ‚Üí /lib/actions/search.ts
   export async function searchFragrances(
     query: string,
     filters?: SearchFilters
   );
   export async function getSearchSuggestions(query: string);
   ```

3. **Performance Optimization (Week 2.3 - 4 hours)**
   - Implement caching for heavy AI operations
   - Add background job processing for recommendations
   - Optimize database queries with proper indexing

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] All user interactions use Server Actions consistently
- [ ] API routes only handle external system integrations
- [ ] No performance regression in recommendation generation
- [ ] Sub-2 second response times for quiz processing

-- Enhanced User Preferences (basic)
user_preferences (user_id, scent_family_id, preference_score, source)

-- Performance Indexes (missing)
CREATE INDEX idx_fragrances_family ON fragrances(fragrance_family);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_collections_user ON user_collections(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_fragrance_search ON fragrances USING gin(to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || brand));
```

**Implementation Tasks:**

1. **Hierarchical Scent Taxonomy (Week 3.1 - 6 hours)**
   - Create scent_families table with parent/child relationships
   - Migrate existing fragrance_family data to hierarchical structure
   - Update recommendation engine to use hierarchy

2. **User Preference Modeling (Week 3.2 - 4 hours)**
   - Enhanced preference tracking beyond quiz responses
   - Behavioral preference learning from user interactions
   - Multi-dimensional preference scoring

3. **Performance Optimization (Week 3.3 - 3 hours)**
   - Add strategic database indexes for fast queries
   - Implement query optimization for recommendation generation
   - Add database monitoring and performance tracking

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Database queries average <50ms response time
- [ ] Recommendation quality improves with hierarchical data
- [ ] User preference learning enhances personalization
- [ ] Database can handle 1000+ concurrent users

### üìÅ **Critical Issue 4: File Structure Simplification (SCE-109)**

**Current State:** 200+ files with complex nested structure
**Impact:** Developer onboarding difficulty, maintenance overhead
**Priority:** P2 - Medium

**Simplification Strategy:**

```
Current Complex Structure ‚Üí Target Domain Structure:

/components/quiz/ (15 files)     ‚Üí /components/domains/quiz/ (5 core files)
/components/collection/ (20+ files) ‚Üí /components/domains/collection/ (8 files)
/components/search/ (12 files)   ‚Üí /components/domains/search/ (4 files)
/components/social/ (12 files)   ‚Üí Remove (post-MVP features)
/lib/services/ (8+ files)       ‚Üí /lib/domains/*/services.ts
```
