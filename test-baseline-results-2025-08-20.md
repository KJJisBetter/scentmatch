# Test Baseline Results - Pre SCE-52 Cleanup

**Date:** 2025-08-20  
**Duration:** 3+ minutes (timed out)  
**Command:** `npm run test:unit`

## Baseline Summary

The test suite was run to establish a baseline before SCE-52 cleanup. Several existing issues were identified that are NOT related to the upcoming cleanup:

### Test Categories Observed

1. **✅ Passing Tests** - Many tests completed successfully
2. **❌ Failing Tests** - Database schema mismatches, missing columns
3. **⏱️ Timeout Tests** - API integration tests exceeding 5000ms timeout  
4. **⏸️ Skipped Tests** - Search performance tests marked as skipped

### Key Issues Identified (Pre-Cleanup)

#### Database Schema Issues
- Missing column: `user_collections.usage_frequency`
- Function errors: `this.getUserCollection is not a function`
- Vector search failures: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'embedding')`

#### Performance Issues  
- API integration tests timing out at 5000ms
- Data quality API endpoints exceeding timeout
- Enhanced search integration timeouts

#### Files with Test Issues
- `tests/lib/recommendation-engine.test.ts` - Database column missing
- `tests/lib/collection-intelligence.test.ts` - Function reference errors
- `tests/api/comprehensive-api-integration.test.ts` - Timeout issues
- `tests/api/data-quality.test.ts` - API timeout issues
- `tests/api/enhanced-search-integration.test.ts` - Search timeout issues

## Important Notes for Cleanup

### Expected Impact
The SCE-52 cleanup should **NOT** affect these existing test failures since:
- We're only removing unused AI files (verified zero imports)
- Database schema issues are unrelated to file cleanup
- API timeouts are performance/infrastructure related

### Success Criteria Post-Cleanup
✅ **Success:** Same test pattern (same failures, same passes)  
❌ **Regression:** New failures related to removed files  
⚠️ **Investigation needed:** Any changes to existing failure patterns

### Monitoring Strategy
After cleanup, run same test suite and compare:
1. **New failures** = potential issues from removed files
2. **Same failures** = expected baseline maintained
3. **Fewer failures** = unexpected improvements (investigate)

## Test Coverage Areas

### Working Systems (Likely Safe to Clean)
- Basic API endpoints that passed
- Component rendering tests
- Database connection tests
- Authentication flows

### Fragile Systems (Monitor Closely)  
- AI recommendation engine tests
- Vector similarity operations
- Real-time features
- Collection intelligence system

## Cleanup Validation Plan

1. **Remove unused files** in batches
2. **Run focused tests** on AI-related modules after each batch
3. **Full test suite** after major cleanup phases
4. **Compare results** to this baseline
5. **Rollback immediately** if new failures appear

---

**Conclusion:** Baseline established with known issues. Cleanup should maintain same test pattern without introducing new failures.
